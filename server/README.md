**A real-time web application with PWA capabilities with end to end encryption.**

**We are using [socket.io](https://socket.io) for realtime bi-lateral communication between clients and server. With the help of encryption algorithm I will be encrypting the chat's messages it can be either a video, image or a text.**

**We are using Github Actions as our CI/CD tool to automate test and building of our web applications. We also have got access to the status badge for coverage report from coveralls.io, Client side deployment status from Netlify, but unfortunately as we are using Heroku for our server side deployment we don't have access to badge or something**
