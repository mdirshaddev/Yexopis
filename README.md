**This is a Real time chat application with end 2 end encryption support. I have used a simple algorithm for encrypting the chat data. I have implemented *3 Tier Architecture*. Client is hosted using `Netlify`, Server is hosted on `Google Cloud Platform App Engine`. The Database is served using `AWS RDS PostgreSQL` is a Object Oriented Relational *SQL Database* and `AWS ElastiCache Redis` is a *NoSQL Database* for *Storing some sensitive information and caching the API Response*. Using `Github Actions` *CI/CD pipelines I am automating tests, linting, building and deployment* of this web application to ensure the correctness of this application. For building this application I have used `Socket.io` which is just an *implementation of Websocket*s not a full fledged `Websockets`. I am also using `Trello` for Project management. In order to make this code more readable and modular I am implementing MVC(Model View Controller) design pattern**
